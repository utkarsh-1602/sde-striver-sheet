    Name : Find GCD of two numbers

    Problem Statement: Find the gcd of two numbers.

    Example 1:
    Input: num1 = 4, num2 = 8
    Output: 4
    Explanation: Since 4 is the greatest number which divides both num1 and num2.

    Example 2:
    Input: num1 = 3, num2 = 6
    Output: 3
    Explanation: Since 3 is the greatest number which divides both num1 and num2.

    Approach : optimal (using Euclideanâ€™s theorem)
    // Gcd is the greatest number which is divided by both a and b.If a number is divided by both a and b, it is should be divided by (a-b) and b as well.
    gcd(a,b) = gcd(b,a%b)
