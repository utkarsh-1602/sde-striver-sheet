/*
    Name : Implement stack using linked list

    Problem Statement: Basic knowledge of stack and operations in the linked list.

    But Why to use linked list ? 
    Use linked list for the stack, when the size of the stack is not known in advance.

    Approach: we will use head of linked list as top() of the stack 

    Time Complexity: 
    for adding node in the beginning of the linked list : O(1)
    for removing the first node from the linked list : O(1)

    Space Complexity: O(N)
