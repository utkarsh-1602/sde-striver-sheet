/*
    Name : Largest Odd Number in String

    Problem Statement: You are given a string num, representing a large integer. Return the largest-valued odd integer (as a string) that is a non-empty substring of num, or an empty string "" if no odd integer exists.

    Input: num = "52"
    Output: "5"
    Explanation: The only non-empty substrings are "5", "2", and "52". "5" is the only odd number.
    Example 2:

    Input: num = "4206"
    Output: ""
    Explanation: There are no odd numbers in "4206".
    Example 3:

    Input: num = "35427"
    Output: "35427"
    Explanation: "35427" is already an odd number.
