/*
    Name : Implement Upper Bound

    Problem Statement: Given a sorted array of N integers and an integer x, write a program to find the upper bound of x.

    Example 1:
    Input Format: N = 4, arr[] = {1,2,2,3}, x = 2
    Result: 3
    Explanation: Index 3 is the smallest index such that arr[3] > x.

    Example 2:
    Input Format: N = 6, arr[] = {3,5,8,9,15,19}, x = 9
    Result: 4
    Explanation: Index 4 is the smallest index such that arr[4] > x.

    Approach : optimal  

    Time Complexity: O(logN), where N = size of the given array.
    Reason: We are basically using the Binary Search algorithm.

    Space Complexity: O(1) as we are using no extra space.
